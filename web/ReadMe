YOUR PARTNER IN EXAMS
A sample university website for sharing mock question papers to the students. This is the authentication part of the website.

students are required to sign in before actually accessing the mock papers, in case if some one does not have a user account they can sign up for free.


Hope you liked my website's authentication sample page, apart from it the actual sign in / sign up page, the website can also calculate the gpa of student, provide motivational blog and some required books pdf.

Also the website uses mysql database through xampp for storing data of registered students.
