students are required to sign in before actually accessing the mock papers, in case if some one does not have a user account they can sign up for free.

## Xampp configuration

1. The website used xampp for connection and without a online sql server it cannot work. The database which is been used by the site is MYSQL through PHPMYadmin.
2. To run the website, first install xampp [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and add the folder web in the folder named htdocs inside xampp folder in your drive.
3. Dont forget to start Apache and mysql in xampp control panel. [Note: If you have installed MYSQL before, you will nwwd to change the port number for this sql server otherwise mysql won't start.]
4. You can type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ to use database server.

Hope you liked my website's authentication sample page, apart from it the actual sign in / sign up page, the website can also calculate the gpa of student, provide motivational blog and some required books pdf. The website is a simple working model but lacks styling and other aspects which can be added by further detailing.

Also the website uses mysql database through xampp for storing data of registered students.
